# end-semister-project-oop-java-
“HEALTHAHOLIC”
READ ME FILE:
Our application for our end semester project is a kind of application that is mixture of health suggestions (both physical and mental)and some games and riddles brain bosters brain teasers that boost our energy level.The motive behind that  application is that we are so much busy in our daily life and find no time for our daily mental and physical health maintenance and therapy.so this is beneficial as it suggest some daily based exercises to release our tension and fatique.
                             Code for this application is written in java using two compilers that are netbeans(for simple coding layout without javafx) and intellij(for converting the code into the graphical user interface using javafx).
CODE FOR OUR APPLICATION INCLUDES:
                               Our code includes total of 13 classes and and 7 .jpeg files and also one media file.this code aims to achieve four main pilers of  object  oriented programming  and we achieved all these pillers.
Demonstration about running the code:
                                Firstly,user menu opens and ask you for login both ways if you are new user or old user then if you are old user it ask you for your id and name and matches with your information stored in the database if it matches it allows you to chose the different options of healthaholic and move further trying some options with physical health some with mental health also play games that boost your iq level and maintains ,improves  your physical health.also there are options if you want to check your credencials and there is also an option for your comments.
                             If you login as a new user it asks you for your credentials and once you enter all information it stores your information in the database and assigns you the unique id which you have to remember for latter usage with apps and shows the button with title “lets start”.when you click that you are open with main menu with different options you can choose any of them.

Also,another feature is sound you can also turn on and off the music and increase or decrease the volume as well.
This  code is very descriptive due to comments in it.and after completing with this our learning outcomes are:
•	Better detail understanding of oop concepts (classes and objects and 4 pillars inheritance,polymorphism,encapsulation,abstraction)
•	Coding in java.
•	Javafx.
•	Dealing with animations.
•	Dealing with  media files and images.
